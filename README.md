# MedGroupFinder
Website assisting students in accessing their individual course schedules (practical sessions) by entering their student ID, with the option to download this schedule in image or ics format.

## JSON Data
I have created a template intended for testing the website with demo information instead of the real JSON database which contains students' real data.
You'll have to change the path of the JSON file in `script/fetch.js` line 8 from `data/groupeq6.json` to `data/jsonTemplateDemo.json` in order to use it.
The demo students ID are 123456 123789
